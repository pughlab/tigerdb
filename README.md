IMiC readme here (how to start, how each service works)

Requires Node 16 and Docker (should come with `docker compose` command)
```
npm install
cp sample.env .env
cp ui/sample.ui.env ui/.env
```

Need to spin up to get values for editing the .env files.
```
make setup-volumes
make dev
```

In `.env`, find `KEYCLOAK_SERVER_PUBLIC_KEY` from the Keycloak console (localhost:8080) realm public key : `Realm Settings` -> `Keys` -> `Public Key` and add
```
NEO4J_URI=bolt://your_local_machine_ip_from_internet_settings:7687

...

KEYCLOAK_SERVER_HOST=your_local_machine_ip_from_internet_settings
KEYCLOAK_SERVER_PUBLIC_KEY=key_from_keycloak_admin_console

...

MINIO_IP=your_local_machine_ip_from_internet_settings
```
As well as in `ui/.env`
```
KEYCLOAK_SERVER_HOST_AND_PORT=your_local_machine_ip_from_internet_settings
...
WEBPACK_PUBLIC_IP=your_local_machine_ip_from_internet_settings
```

Keycloak `Valid Redirect URIs` must also be changed.
Go into `Keycloak console > Clients > pibu-app > Settings > Valid Redirect URIs` and add
```
https://localhost/*
https://localhost:4001/*
https://localhost:3001/*
``` 
On production, this should be changed to the app URL (i.e. whatever the domain name is).

You may also need to change some Docker options to give your containers (specifically the `api` container) enough memory to run (~4gb). 

When using the GraphQL Playground (localhost:4001/graphql), your header should have a `authorization: Bearer ${token}` field in order to be authenticated as a KeycloakUser.
Token can be generated by using the `get_keycloak_token.sh` script.

For Funnel, don't forget to build the `funnel-base` image. Specify `--platform linux/arm64/v8` if running on M1 Mac (also may need to do this for some services in `docker-compose.yml`).
```
docker build -f api/src/funnel/funnel-base.dockerfile -t funnel-base .
```

To set the roles of a test user, go into `Keycloak console > Manage > Users > ... > Role Mappings > Client Roles > pibu-app`
and add piped structure roles
```
role|allowedRoles|acceptedTOS
role|allowedRoles|approved
role|allowedRoles|admin
role|allowedSites|admin
role|allowedStudies|admin
```

    During development and you're using Chrome and it prevents you from opening the page due to certificate validation, type `thisisunsafe` to skip.
